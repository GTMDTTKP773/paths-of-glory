  Paths of Glory, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts Award winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to
  step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the
  Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial
  German Army to win your rightful “Place in the Sun." As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring
  your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is “The War to End
  All Wars." Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths
  of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.
