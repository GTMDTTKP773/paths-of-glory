Paths of Glory allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and
marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you
must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial
German Army to win your rightful "Place in the Sun." As the Entente Powers you
must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and
ensure this is "The War to End All Wars." Both players will find their
generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's
innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.
